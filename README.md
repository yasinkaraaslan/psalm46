# The Secret of Psalm 46 (2002)

First presented on 23 March 2002 at the Game Developers Conference in San Jose, California. It was accompanied by a digital video of a total solar eclipse, synchronized to a harpsichord recording of J.S. Bach’s Die Kunst der Fuge (The Art of Fugue, BWV 1080, 1751).

A slightly revised version was presented at Worcester Polytech on 18 January 2007.

On 23 May 2011, the Drama Society at the University of York (UK) presented Hamish Todd’s The Name of the Power That Moves You, a play based on this lecture.

Galician artist Iván Sende adapted the lecture into a Spanish graphic novel, published November 2016 by Diábolo Ediciones.

Included are a transcript sourced from [here](http://ludix.com/moriarty/psalm46.html) in Markdown (with a batch script for generating a PDF via pandoc), a standalone PDF version, and a February 2010 studio recording of the lecture produced for inclusion in Jonathan Blow’s game The Witness.
